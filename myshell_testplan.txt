 In process the implement, I always use printf to print the important pointer value and the string and the printf code already be commented.
 If you get the expected output, then continue to write the other parts' code.

 When finished the program, run the program and test the command :
 cd ..
 cd ~
 cd test
 touch 1.txt
 ls
 ls -l
 ./test
 la
 exit
 cat square.c | wc -l
 cat makefile | wc -l 
 fal
 cd eeeeee

 Using those commands, and then compare to the reall shell out put.
 Also, you can enter some wrong input, then you can get message from the shell which indicats you are worng.
 If get the unexpect output, that means you need to modify your code.
 After test, I found my shell run well
